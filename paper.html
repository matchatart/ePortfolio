        Introduction
    </h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;padding:3.5rem;padding-top: 0rem; padding-bottom: 1rem;">
        Museum labels are a type of genre that aims to inform readers about a specific artwork. It works to give background 
        information to help readers learn more about an artwork. Some common tools that museum labels use are a title, a 
        description, and/or information about the artist (Lin & Yao, 2018). Since museum labels are writings that interact 
        with a diverse audience, curators have to write labels that appeal to a general part of the population, which usually 
        are adults. They write about the artwork such as how it was created, what influenced the artist, background information 
        about the artist, or even information about the time period that the artwork was created in so that readers gain an 
        understanding and form their own opinion or interpretation.

    <p style="text-align:left;padding:3.5rem;padding-top: 0rem; padding-bottom: 1rem;">
        Museum labels have many different components that have been studied. There have been many studies where researchers 
        looked at how museum labels affected appreciation or visual engagement of viewers in a quantitative method 
        (Reitstätter, et al., 2022). Some studies have looked at one part of a museum label, such as the title. A study by 
        Keith Millis saw how titles itself affect the aesthetic experience and overall interpretation of artwork and found that 
        more elaborative titles increased the aesthetic experience and overall interpretation (Millis, Keith, 2001). Other 
        studies looked at what length of description readers preferred and how it affected their satisfaction and appreciation 
        (Temme, 1992). In addition, studies have used a control group to compare the effect they were looking at. One common 
        effect that studies have looked at was visual engagement. To see how viewers engaged with the artwork, some studies 
        tracked the eye movement of participants and measured the time (Lin & Yao, 2018, Reitstätter, et al., 2022) while one 
        measured only the time participants looked at an artwork (Smith, et al., 2017).

        Although these studies prove that there is some effect that museum labels bring to the readers, there has not been a 
        rhetorical analysis of how and why each tool that creates the genre affects readers. According to the study, “Reddit’s 
        “Explain Like I’m Five”: Technical Descriptions in the Wild” by Ehren Helmut Pflugfelder, rhetorical analysis allows 
        certain genres to be broken down in order to understand how it affects readers. In order to see how museum labels 
        affect readers in a rhetorical sense, I will be looking at the question, “How do museum labels affect the understanding 
        of readers?” I will be doing a rhetorical analysis on the museum labels and see how it affects me.

    <p style="text-align:left;padding:3.5rem;padding-top: 0rem; padding-bottom: 1rem;">
        To figure out how museum labels affect a reader’s understanding of an artwork, an analysis of museum labels as well as 
        my own written reaction in attempting to understand the artwork was done.
