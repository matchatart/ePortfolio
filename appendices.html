        There is a lot going on in the artwork. There are a lot of different elements such as people, different objects, nature, 
        and statues. 
        If looked at closely there are mountains in the background with some pillars aligned. Some things that I found peculiar 
        in the artwork are the unnaturally long spoon, a red shoe hanging on a string, statues of what seem to be humans, and just 
        a lot of weird structures. From the shadows of the artwork, it seems the sun is rising.
        Overall, I do not know what the artwork really means. I am guessing that it is the “calm before the storm”. The foreground 
        shows barely any light and is dark compared to the middle ground and background. The middle and background are all bright 
        and painted with light colors with a few shadows cast assuming by the sun. Furthermore, it looks like the people in the 
        foreground (the dark) are approaching the light as if it wants to conquer something.

        After reading the label, I came to know that this was not a painting but an actual built piece that Salvador Dali made. 
        I found that cool and interesting since I thought Dali focused only on painting. It said that Dali was interested in 
        theater and optical devices so he decided to try to create his own.
        After reading the label, I wasn’t very satisfied with what I learned since I was still confused about why Dali included 
        certain things. After reading, I see that Dali was not trying to create a uniform scene but simply putting 
        “peculiar worlds” together. How I understood this was that this artwork would not make any sense since each pane has its 
        own story. So although the overall artwork could most likely have no meaning, I am curious as to what each pane means or 
        portray.

        From just the title of the artwork, I think the artwork is trying to convey the desperate want of keeping the memories. 
        At first glance, I thought the distorted clocks represented how time is something that cannot be managed by people. I 
        thought it represented the difficulties of trying to keep time even though time can only move forward. After keeping the 
        title in mind, I thought that the artwork depicted the want to stay within a specific memory. Basically trying to “freeze” 
        time. I thought the small thing on top of the golden clock was a fly which to me shows how long the artist or person has 
        stayed in the specific memory. This artwork has a lot of confusing things. I’m not sure what the white thing is on the 
        ground and what meaning the background/setting holds. Furthermore, it seems like there are ants on the orange/bronze 
        clock, but I am not sure what that is supposed to mean. I thought it was just a weird pattern at first, but when I saw it 
        closer it was ants. Although the person has stayed in the memory, time moves on?

    <p style="text-align:left;padding:3.5rem;padding-top: 0rem; padding-bottom: 1rem;">
        After reading the description of the artwork I could understand what each element represented, but not the overall meaning 
        of the artwork and why it was created. I found out that ants represented decay while the clocks represented the loss of 
        permanence. The background of the painting was actual cliffs from the coast of Catalonia, his home. The white blob is 
        assumed to be a self-portrait of Dalí.
        <i>“…they picture “the camembert of time,” in Dalí’s phrase. Here time must lose all meaning.“</i>
        Dali paints the clocks as if they lost their solid form in order to represent the meaningless time. Dali creates a setting 
        within the painting that does not have and depict time. However, it’s interesting to see that even in the most surreal 
        painting there was a hint of reality—the cliffs from the coast of Catalonia. So overall, I learned what certain elements 
        represented and what they meant, however, I did not understand the reason why he decided to paint such things. One detail 
        that is mentioned is that the prior year the artwork was created, Dali was cultivating his own psychotic hallucinations 
        to create art. So I am assuming the reason why the artwork does not make much sense is because of this drug and also 
        simply because it is surrealism.

    <p style="text-align:left;padding:3.5rem;padding-top: 0rem; padding-bottom: 1rem;">
        At first glance, it is obvious that two people are kissing, but with a piece of cloth/fabric that is covering their 
        whole heads. I genuinely do not understand what this means. I cannot even make a guess. I am assuming that one is 
        female and one is male and are kissing but that is all I can take from this artwork.

    <p style="text-align:left;padding:3.5rem;padding-top: 0rem; padding-bottom: 1rem;"><i>After reading the label:</i></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;padding:3.5rem;padding-top: 0rem; padding-bottom: 1rem;">
        After reading the label, I felt enlightened to learn what the artwork was about. The people kissing have their faces 
        covered in order to stop our pleasure of seeing love blossom and, what seems to me, have us question who might the 
        people be or why they are covered. According to the label, the use of the cloth covering the face was a large 
        “Surrealist interest” as it kind of told people to look under the mask and deeper.
