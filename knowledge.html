            After gathering data and analyzing it, I made connections to different sources and determined whether or
            not my research found something. Through my results I found that different techniques of museum labels usually 
            guide readers to understanding what the artwork means.

            Peer reviews were assignments aimed to help each other and critique each other papers. With peer reviews,
            it allowed me to get a new perspective on my drafts so that I could see what I needed to improve on. I was 
            also able to put in my input for others. This is related to the outcome since I was able to form my own
            conclusions/opinions of a different person's paper and then give feedback to them so that they were able to
            determine whether or not the change was needed. The artifact shown above is part of a peer review that I did 
            for someone.
