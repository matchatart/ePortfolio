            This assignment had us read a source to help us understand the different methods there are to 
            gather data and make sense of it. At this point, I had already chose the genre I was going to be researching,
            so I took this opprtunity to explore the different ways I could potentially carry out my research. Through
            this assignment I was able

            An annotated bibliography is where a source is read to identify the purpose, the findings, the methods,
            and the credibility. Sources can be anything that may be useful to our own individiual research such as 
            magazines, books, videos, papers, and etc. This assignment was to help us gather different secondary 
            sources that we could potentionally use in our own research. At this point, we were gathering sources and
            determining whether it was good or bad once we were done analyzing it. Through this artifact I was able to 
            find sources for my paper and start figuring out what my question/gap for my research would be. I was also able
            to learn how to determine what sources were considered good or bad.
