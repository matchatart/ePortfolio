        <p><i>2023</i></p>
        <p style="padding:2em; margin:2em; margin-top:0em; text-align:justify;">
            My literature review has been revised through the help of my peers. Peer reviews helped me refine my paper
            and gave me feedback on things that I did not notice. While peer reviews did help, the feedback from the 
            professor was the most helpful as it showed more insight and pointed out detauls that I would have never
            noticed or thought of. The artifact above shows the before and after of certain part in my literature review.
