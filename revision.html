            By receiving feedback for my rough draft I was able to edit my paper and make it better. The peer reviews
            gave me insight on what should be fixed. The artifact shown above is an excerpt from my rought and final draft.
            The left paragraph is from my rough draft and the right is from my final. I thought the paragraph was fine, but after
            receiving feedback from my peers and teacher, I realized that it was important to clarify/state the relationship
            between my reponses and the analysis of the museum labels.

            My literature review has been revised through the help of my peers. Peer reviews helped me refine my paper
            and gave me feedback on things that I did not notice. While peer reviews did help, the feedback from the 
            professor was the most helpful as it showed more insight and pointed out detauls that I would have never
            noticed or thought of. The artifact above shows the before and after of a certain part in my literature review.
            I decided to add more information about museum labels.
