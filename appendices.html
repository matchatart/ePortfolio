        There is a lot going on in the artwork. There are a lot of different elements such as people, different objects, nature, 
        and statues. 
        If looked at closely there are mountains in the background with some pillars aligned. Some things that I found peculiar 
        in the artwork are the unnaturally long spoon, a red shoe hanging on a string, statues of what seem to be humans, and just 
        a lot of weird structures. From the shadows of the artwork, it seems the sun is rising.
        Overall, I do not know what the artwork really means. I am guessing that it is the “calm before the storm”. The foreground 
        shows barely any light and is dark compared to the middle ground and background. The middle and background are all bright 
        and painted with light colors with a few shadows cast assuming by the sun. Furthermore, it looks like the people in the 
        foreground (the dark) are approaching the light as if it wants to conquer something.

        After reading the label:
        After reading the label, I came to know that this was not a painting but an actual built piece that Salvador Dali made. 
        I found that cool and interesting since I thought Dali focused only on painting. It said that Dali was interested in 
        theater and optical devices so he decided to try to create his own.
        After reading the label, I wasn’t very satisfied with what I learned since I was still confused about why Dali included 
        certain things. After reading, I see that Dali was not trying to create a uniform scene but simply putting 
        “peculiar worlds” together. How I understood this was that this artwork would not make any sense since each pane has its 
        own story. So although the overall artwork could most likely have no meaning, I am curious as to what each pane means or 
        portray.
