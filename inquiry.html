                This was the first minor assignment completed in the semester. Through this assignment I was able to learn
                how to question certain things, specifically genres, and start thinking about which genre to look at for my
                research. This reading response was the first assignment where I looked at a secondary 
                source and started learning how to "read" and gather information. Furthermore, it helped me how 
                to think about genres in a way I have never thought of. The artifact shown above shows my new understanding
                of research and how it should be approached.

                Freewrites were done during class and had questions that jogged our minds to think about our research
                and help us process and think what we were going to be doing in our research. 
                Through freewrites, I was able to process some of my thoughts and think how to carry out my research.
                I was able to ponder on different aspects of my research and decide whether or not to do certain things.
                This artifact in particular is one freewrite done at the beginning of the semester to start thinking about
                and noticing different genres in our lives. This helped get a feel for what genres were as I had some
                confusion at the beginning of the semester.
