            This reading response looked at how to breakdown genre and show a new perspective on what genre is.
            Through this assignment, I was able to get an even more clearer defintion on what genre was and start
            thinking about what genres to look at for my research. This reading response helped me get a glimpse of
            understanding what multiple ways of writing since this was the first where I had looked at more than one
            source, one being a video and one being a paper.

        <p style="padding:2em; margin:2em; margin-top:0em; text-align:justify;">
            While gathering data for my research I looked at 3 different artworks and recorded the response of my
            understanding of the artwork. By observing the images provided by the Museum of Modern Art I was able to 
            record my initial understanding and then later my overall understanding after reading the museum label.
            The artifact shown above is a part of a document where I gathered my data. Gathering data in this way 
            helped me organize and see what was important which then overall helped me organize the data part 
            of my final paper.
