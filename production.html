            The annotated bibliography was a writing product that summarized the sources that were related to my 
            research. While gathering secondary sources for the annotated bibliography, I had to determine whether or not 
            it was relevant to my research or genre. After I thought it was good, I put it into my annotated bibliography
            and started "dissecting" the sources. I looked for the methods, the results, etc. With this assignment I was able 
            to learn what "good" sources were and determine what would be beneficial for my research which would then be presented 
            to the community I was aiming at.

        <p style="padding:2em; margin:2em; margin-top:0em; text-align:justify;">
            The literature review was the first assignment where I put together a writing product by looking 
            at multiple of sources related to my research and chosen genre. The annotated bibliography helped 
            me organize my thoughts while the literature review put the sources together and helped me figure out 
            my gap for the study. In relation to the outcome, I was able to figure out what sources were important 
            and relevant to my study and to the community I was aiming at.
